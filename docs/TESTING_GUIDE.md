# Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the testing strategy and procedures for the cryptocurrency trading platform.

## Automated Testing

### System Audit Component
The platform includes a comprehensive System Audit component that automatically tests:

- Database connectivity
- User authentication
- Bot functionality
- Trading system operations
- Following system
- Data persistence
- API connections
- Real-time updates

### Running System Audit
1. Navigate to Settings tab
2. Click "Run Full Audit" button
3. Monitor progress and review results
4. Address any failed or warning items

## Manual Testing Procedures
