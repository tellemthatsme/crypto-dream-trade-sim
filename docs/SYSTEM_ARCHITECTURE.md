- `market_data_cache`: Cached market data for performance

### Security
- All tables implement Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Audit logging for all significant actions

## API Integration

### Supabase Services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
